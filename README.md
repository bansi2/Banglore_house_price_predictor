# 🏠 Bangalore House Price Prediction

This project is a **Machine Learning-based web application** that predicts the price of houses in Bangalore. The model is trained on a dataset of Bangalore property listings and allows users to input property details like location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and bathrooms to get an estimated price.


## 🚀 Project Overview

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (via Flask templates)
* **Backend:** Python (Flask)
* **Machine Learning Model:** Ridge Regression (best performing model based on R² score)
* **Dataset:** Bangalore Housing Prices Dataset

---

## 📦 Features

* Predict house prices based on:

  * Location
  * Total Square Feet
  * Number of Bathrooms
  * Number of Bedrooms (BHK)
* Simple and interactive web interface using Flask
* Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline
* Model training using Ridge Regression for better regularization and accuracy

## 📊 Dataset Details

* **Source:** Kaggle real estate data
* **Columns:**

  * `location`
  * `size`
  * `total_sqft`
  * `bath`
  * `price`
* Cleaned by handling missing values, transforming size into BHK, converting sqft ranges, and handling location sparsity.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Process

1. **Data Cleaning:**

   * Fill missing values in `location`, `size`, and `bath`.
   * Convert `size` to numerical BHK.
   * Convert sqft ranges into average numeric values.
   * Handle outliers based on price per sqft and BHK anomalies.

2. **Feature Engineering:**

   * One-Hot Encoding for `location`.
   * Scaling of numeric features (`total_sqft`, `bath`, `bhk`).

3. **Model Training:**

   * Models tested: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression.
   * **Ridge Regression** performed best and was chosen for deployment.

4. **Model Evaluation:**

   * Evaluated using R² Score.

5. **Deployment:**

   * Created a web application using Flask.

## 🔧 Requirements


```
Flask
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

---

## 📈 Model File

The trained model file `RidgeModel.pkl` is generated after running the Jupyter Notebook or the training script. This file is required for the Flask app to make predictions.

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Add model selection for users (choose between Linear, Lasso, Ridge).
* Deploy on cloud platforms (Heroku, Render, etc.).
* Add more features like year built, floor number, etc.
* Improve UI/UX.
